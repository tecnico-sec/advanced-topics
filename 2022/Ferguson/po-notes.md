## Contribution

_What are the significant issues addressed in this publication?_

- Attackers can break into systems by running a bunch of tools and observing how systems answer to these tools. While new attacks and new defenses keep raising the bar from a security perspective, little to no work studied how deception can play a critical role in a defensive scenario by affecting the behavior of attackers, making them waste more time or be more cautious.


_What are the main contributions? (as stated by the authors)_

- Authors devised a controlled experiment to study how the presence of decoys in a system and whether attackers are aware of such presence (truly or not) can affect their behavior: by delaying, deterring, or disrupting attacks.
- Authors investigate four hypotheses on whether decoys and cyberpsychology are effective as cyber defense.

### Strengths

_In your opinion, what are the strengths of the publication?_

- Authors make an extensive evaluation of how decoys and cyberpsychology can affect attackers, being the first (or one of the first) paper that performs such kind of study
- Real live study with many experts (acting as attackers) in different conditions make the results to be statistically valid
- Many data points were collected: keylogs, network traffic, attackers' findings (during and after the study), screen captures/recordings, IDS alerts using traffic captures, and decoy alerts.
- For different types of attacker progress, the authors correlate the observed results with the hypotheses that support such results (number of targets that were attacked supports the hypotheses that "deception is effective even if the attacker is aware of its presence"; attackers unaware of deception made more progress supporting hypotheses that "defensive cyber tools and psychological deception impede attackers who seek to penetrate
computer systems and exfiltrate information"; ...)

### Weaknesses

_In your opinion, what are the weak points in this publication?_

- Some terms that are used along the paper are not correctly explained, making it difficult to follow along for outsiders of the area: red teamers, cyber attack stages (reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, ...),
- 
### Points of interest

- Examples of scenarios
  - Participants unaware of decoys take less time to target their first system
  - Participants that did not face decoys are more likely to retry a failed exploit attempt
  - Participants that did not face decoys reported more attack successes
  - More participants that did not face decoys were able to exfiltrate more information from their targets compared to participants that faced decoys  
  - Participants that did not face decoys registered more keystrokes
  - Participants unaware of decoys took more time to initiate an interaction with a decoy
  - Fewer bytes were sent to natural systems in which decoys were also available in the network
  - Perception is different in each condition (Decoy Present/Absent and Attacker Informed/Uninformed) - less reported attack failures in Absent/Uninformed and Present/Informed; more participants considered the network security in the Absent/Informed and Present/Uninformed

### Questions for discussion

1. From this study, it looks like having the attacker aware of the presence of decoys affects its behavior... However, attackers that were not aware were able to make more progress... On a real-live system, how can an attacker know if there are decoys or not? How can a company affect the attacker's behavior? How does this study translate to live systems?

2. From this study, it looks like decoys can affect attacker behavior... So does that mean that real products should "mimic fake vulnerabilities" so that attackers waste time trying something that will lead them nowhere on real products? Or should companies place dumb nodes in their networks?
